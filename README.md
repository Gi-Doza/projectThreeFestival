# Project 3: Open Doors Festival

**By: Gian Mendoza**

## Project Statement

1. **What Is Open Doors Festival?**  
   Open Doors Festival is about bringing the community together to raise awareness and support for homelessness issues in the Bay Area while seeking solutions to the increasing cost of housing.

   The homeless population in California makes up 25% of the U.S. homeless population. As a resident, I find this unacceptable, especially given California's strong economy. It’s absurd that California cannot find a solution for affordable housing, leading to a rise in homelessness.

2. **My Role**  
   As a web designer, my goals for this project are to inform audiences about what the Open Doors Festival is about, help them engage with the event, and inspire them to support this important cause.

3. **Design Philosophy**  
   My design philosophy for the website is to keep it minimal while presenting the most important aspects of the festival upfront, making them easy to find and understand. I aim to balance aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that navigating the site is simple, the content is easy to read, and the festival's purpose is communicated clearly.

4. **Connection to the Community**  
   My inspiration comes from firsthand experience trying to find affordable housing, competing with thousands of others. After more than a year, it’s still a challenge. Since 2020, commuting almost daily from the East Bay to San Francisco, I’ve noticed the drastic increase in the homeless population. I hope to see meaningful change, which is why I am designing the site for this festival.

## Technical Overview

1. **Website Functionality and Features**  
   Key features of the website include:  
   - **Event Schedule**: Ensures audiences are informed about what is happening, when, and where.  
   - **Donation Portal**: Provides an avenue for community members to support the cause financially.  
   - **Volunteer Sign-Up**: Encourages more involvement by making it easy to join the effort.

2. **Technologies Used**  
   I will utilize **HTML** and **CSS** for coding, along with **Figma** and **Adobe Suites** for design.  
   You can view the Figma design for this project here: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/1j5h5PnJaMlfLYYuKgFfOG/DES-228----Festival?node-id=11-164&t=5sv7owOd6UlkPYjF-1).

3. **Hosting and Platforms**  
   The website will be hosted on **[GitHub](https://gi-doza.github.io/projectThreeFestival/)** and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

4. **Design Elements**  
   - **Color Scheme**:  
     The palette includes mainly Blue, shades of Green, Brown, and neutral colors such as Black and White:  
     - **Blue**: Represents hope, trust, stability, and openness, aligning with the festival's focus on inspiring change.  
     - **Green**: Symbolizes growth, renewal, and harmony, reflecting a fresh start.  
     - **Brown**: Conveys warmth, grounding, and reliability, representing practical support and stability.  
     - **Black & White**: Ensures balance, clarity, and inclusivity, creating a professional and approachable design.

   - **Typography**:  
     - **Bebas Neue Pro (Headers)**: Bold, modern, and strong — conveys urgency and importance, drawing attention to key messages.  
     - **Nunito (Body Copy)**: Friendly, approachable, and easy to read — creates a welcoming and accessible experience for users.

5. **Challenges and Solutions**  
   Designing for responsiveness has been a significant challenge. I worked on making one page fully responsive, and adjusting each section to fit smaller screens was very complicated. The ultimate goal is to ensure all pages are responsive across various devices, from phones to tablets and desktops.
